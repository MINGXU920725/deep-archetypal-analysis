\# Deep Archetypal Analysis on MNIST \& KMNIST



This repository contains the implementation of our AE-AA, VAE-AA, and Linear AA models, along with experiment scripts and analysis notebooks.



\## Results



Due to GitHub storage limits, the `results/` folder only keeps \*\*GPU-generated experiment outputs\*\* used to select the optimal archetype number \*\*K\*\*.



All intermediate files produced inside notebooks (latent space, decoded images, reconstructed samples, etc.) are not included.  

They will be \*\*automatically regenerated\*\* when running the notebooks from scratch.



\## Reproduction



To reproduce the analysis:

1\. Simply re-run the Jupyter notebooks.

2\. All necessary result files will be generated automatically.
